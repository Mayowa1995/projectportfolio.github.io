								<div class="image main"><img src="images/DASH.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS</p>
							</p>Base on the analysis, the following key insights are derived:
								<p>1. Retailer Profitability:
								      </p>West Gear was the most profitable retailer with $86 million in profit, followed closely by Foot Locker ($81 million). Walmart had the lowest profit at $26 million.
									  <P>New York was the top-performing state in terms of sales, with $64 million, followed by California ($60 million) and Florida ($59 million).
							    </P>2. Sales Method and Revenue:
							          </p>Online shopping was the most preferred method (50.67%), but in-store sales generated the most revenue (39.63%).
									  <p>This indicates a possible trend where customers make bulk purchases during in-store visits despite a preference for online shopping.
							    </p>3. Regional Sales:
							          </p>The West region led in sales with $0.27 billion, while the Midwest and South regions had lower sales figures.
									  <p>Sales performance varied significantly by month, with the highest revenue in July despite the highest number of units sold in August. March had the lowest revenue despite selling more units than in November.
								</p>4. Product Performance:
							          </p>Men's street footwear generated the highest revenue ($208.83 million) and profit ($82.80 million).
									  <p>Women's athletic footwear had the lowest revenue ($106.63 million) but was not the least sold, indicating varying profit margins across product categories.</p>
								<p>METHODS USED
							</P>The following methods were undertaken to generate this comprehensive analysis:
								<p>1. Data Analysis: The analysis involved evaluating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, profit, products sold, and average unit price. The sales data was broken down by region, retailer, sales method, and product category.
								<p>2. Comparative Analysis: The profitability and sales trends were compared across different retailers, regions, and sales methods to identify patterns and insights.
								<p>3. Dashboard Visualization: Data was visualized through dashboards to highlight trends and insights clearly, aiding in the interpretation of the sales data.
							    <p>RECOMMENDATIONS
							</p>Based on the insights derived from the dashboard, the following recommendations are made:
							    <P>1. Enhance Regional Strategies: Tailor product offerings and stock levels to meet customer preferences in underperforming regions like the South and Midwest to boost sales.
								<P>2. Optimize Online Marketing: Develop targeted marketing strategies to encourage higher spending among online shoppers, possibly through personalized promotions or bundling offers.
								<P>3. Promotional Campaigns: Capitalize on the sales peak in August by implementing marketing and promotional campaigns during this period to further boost revenue.
								<P>4. Investigate Revenue Discrepancies: Conduct a deeper analysis into why higher sales volume in March did not translate into higher revenue compared to other months like November, which had lower sales volume but higher revenue. This could uncover opportunities for pricing or promotional adjustments.
