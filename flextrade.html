									<h1>FLEXTRADE SHOPPING APP USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Dashnoard.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS</p>
							</p>Base on the analysis, the following key insights are derived:
								<p>1. User Engagement Decline:
								      </p>There has been a significant decline in user engagement on the Flex Trade shopping app from 2020 to 2023, with the total number of users decreasing each year (2020: 279 users, 2023: 189 users).
									  <P>The primary reasons for this decline include frequent app crashes, issues with the search functionality, and a cumbersome checkout process, which lead to a high rate of cart abandonment.
							    </P>2. User Feedback Analysis:
							          </p>The analysis revealed that negative feedback nearly equals positive feedback, which is problematic for user retention.
									  <p>Key complaints included app crashes during sessions, bugs during checkout, and poor search feature performance.</p>
							    </p>3. Competitive Market:
							          </p>The app faces stiff competition, and without addressing user experience issues, Flex Trade risks losing even more users to competitors who offer more reliable and user-friendly shopping apps.</P>
								<p>METHODS USED
							</P>The following methods were undertaken to generate this comprehensive analysis:
								<p>1. Data Categorization: The dataset was categorized into three main areasâ€”User Feedback, User Behavior, and App Analysis. This approach helped in isolating specific issues related to user experience and app functionality.
								<p>2. Time-Series Analysis: By extracting the month and year from timestamps, the analysis tracked changes in user engagement and feedback over time, identifying trends and areas requiring attention.
								<p>3. Comparative Feedback Analysis: Feedback from users over different years was compared to understand the progression of issues and their impact on user retention.
								<p>MARKET EXPANSIONS
                                <p>1. Enhancing User Experience: Improving the app's reliability and user interface can help retain existing users and attract new ones, especially in a competitive market.
						        </p>2. Introducing Incentives: Offering discounts, bonuses for referrals, and other incentives can help differentiate Flex Trade from its competitors and encourage user acquisition and retention.
							    </p>RECOMMENDATIONS
							</p>Based on the insights derived from the dashboard, the following recommendations are made:
								<P>1. App Improvement: 
								      </p>Immediate action is needed to resolve technical issues like app crashes, search functionality, and checkout process bugs. Hiring experienced developers to ensure the app meets user expectations is critical.
								</P>2. User-Centric Enhancements: 
									  </P>Implement a more intuitive and faster checkout process to reduce cart abandonment rates.
									  <p>Ensure that the app's performance is optimized to handle user sessions without crashing or lagging.
							    </P>3. Competitive Pricing Strategy: 
								      </P>Conduct market research to align product prices with or slightly below those of competitors. Introducing discounts and promotional pricing could help regain market share.
								</p>4. Referral Program:
								      </p>Launch a referral program offering bonuses to both the referrer and the new user. This could organically increase the user base without heavy investment in traditional marketing.
								</P>CONCLUSIONS
								      </P>The decline in user engagement and the rise in negative feedback indicate that Flex Trade's shopping app is underperforming in a highly competitive market. By addressing the technical and user experience issues identified, and by adopting strategic enhancements such as competitive pricing and referral programs, Flex Trade can improve its market position. Immediate app improvements are essential to reversing the downward trend in user retention and driving future growth.
